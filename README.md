## Description

  

This project is a clone of the Google Chrome dinosaur jumping game but with alternative controls. It was built using the Angular framework with TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In the original dinosaur game by Google, the user uses the keyboard to play the game. In this clone, the game is played using a webcam and hand gestures.

  
## How The Project Works

  

In order for the game to use hand gestures to play the game, the project utilizes the [Handtrack.js library by Victor Dibia](https://github.com/victordibia/handtrack.js/). After importing the library, edits can be made to the Handtrack.js file to adjust what hand gestures (Two open hands, One open hand, Closed hand, etc) can be detected by your webcam. Once the hand gestures have been setup, we can use said hand gestures to run the functions that were coded to control the different actions the jumper character in the game can do (such as jumping or shooting fireballs). The different actions in the game are made using the CSS animation property along. As different hand gestures are done, the game will remove or add certain CSS animations to  the jumping character. The obstacles in the game function the same way.
